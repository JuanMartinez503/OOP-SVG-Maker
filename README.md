# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

## Description
- The purpose of this app is to generate an SVG logo maker using Object-Oriented Programming. I did not receive any starter code to build this app. I also performed tests on the application, I used the jest package to make sure everything was working as intended.
- The code uses javascript and it runs on the terminal using node.js.
